Calibration/Application Hints
=============================

This chapter represents the experience in tuning of this function.
Therefor both universal advice and detailed calibration hints as do`s & don`ts, recommended and must application rules are listed.


Universal advice & general method of tuning
-------------------------------------------

#.  Before start tuning, to get a initial feeling of the over all vehicle and chassis characteristics (retunrability behavior, remarkable
    dependencies upon vehicle speed), ActiveReturn should be switched off. (MaxMotTrq =  0 Nm) 

#.  Gridpoints (x-nodes) of NomSteerSpd_AxisX need to be choosen in respect to the remarkable vehicle speed ranges.
    Please consider results of Step1. Typical gridpoints are at 0kph (setpoint 0!), parking speed, the specific speed where
    chassis characteristic changes from non-self-centering to self-centering, speed for country road driving 80-120 kph and approx. vmax.

#.  The Active Return function is a closed loop function realized via P-Controller.
    During tuning the active return function please differ between variables which are defining the desired returning speed of the steering wheel and
    the parameters which are influencing the gain of the function.

    The target returning speed of the steering wheel can be defined in dependancy of steering angle, vehicle speed, TBT.
    The gain defines the "power" of the active return. (dependent on steering angle, vehicle speed, TBT) The gain defines how accurate the target return speed can be achieved.
    Desired returning speed * gain equals the resulting motor torque of the active return.

    * Active Return gain = 0; Active Return output = 0Nm therefore Active Return is deactivated. Set the gain to 0! 
      Desired Returning Speed = 0 (for example AR factor = 0% or Returning speed vs. steering angle = 0) means max possible damping (Desired steering velocity =0 -> the active return counteracts to each deviance from 0)
    * Damping at 0km/h should be realized by 0 °/s target return request and controll gain.

#.  The active return function is a steering feel generating function and should be active in all speed ranges.

#.  ActiveReturn shall be basically used as a steering feel generating function.
    For safety aspects e.g. damping behavior, the ActiveDamping function shall be used.

#.  TThe higher the gain, the more potential disadvantages may occur: e.g. if internal friction over lifetime drops, the ActiveReturn will 
    become too dominant, in case of SWA failure (--> 0°) instabilities may occur, steering feel becomes synthetic.

#.  If the hysteresis function is not available, the ActiveReturn function can be used to generate hysteresis feel.
