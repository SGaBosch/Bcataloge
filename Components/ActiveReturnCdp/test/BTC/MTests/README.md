The script generate_test_data.m generates the data for several BTC test 
cases and stores these test cases in the subfolder "Data". The script should 
be launched from the folder of its location. Up to the postfix, the names 
of the generated test cases are meant to correspond to the names of the 
BTC test cases in the profile ActiveReturnCdp_BTCProfile_et.epp. 
The postfix "IO" indicates that the stored data is the "Inports/Outports" 
data and the postfix "Calibrations" indicates that the stored data is the 
"Calibrations" data for the BTC.
